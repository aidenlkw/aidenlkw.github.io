### BBB: Book Barter Bazaar
Authors: Aiden and Catelyn

## Overview

The problem: Despite finding practically free textbooks online, students may prefer tangible textbooks. However, textbooks can be hella costly. Students need affordable textbooks and need to get rid of textbooks with some $$. 

The solution: users can make listings or search for textbooks. Students can meet up and exchange. Since the seller has their UH email linked, scams can be prevented ðŸ™‚If a student buys a book for $40, he/she can resell the book for $40 depending on the condition. Thus, no money is wasted!

## Approach
The app would have two types of users, a student user which can log in with their UH email, and an admin(s) that can regulate listings and users.
There would be filters for class types like chemistry, math, etc.; filters for cheaper textbooks
Users would click buy which would need to be accepted by the seller, who would then contact the buyer via email ? to meet up for the book

Possible mockup pages:
Landing page â€“ choosing the subject
Subject page â€“ shows all textbook listings in a grid 
Seller page â€“ filling out a form to post textbook; view own listings
User page â€“ shows bookmarked listings 
Textbook page â€“ shows description, image, and sellerâ€™s contact (email)

## Use case ideas
New user goes to landing page, logs in with UH email, gets to home page, sets up profile
User goes to home page, can either go to create a listing page, view userâ€™s listings, bookmarked listings, or search for listings

## Beyond the basics
Upload new and used prices from the UH bookstore to compare 
Users could suggest a different price for a listing which would then need to be accepted by the seller, or rejected
Have an expiration date for listings which would need to be renewed by the seller after some amount of time
Notify user when a desired textbook is listed
Allow users to report listings as inappropriate for the admins to look at and remove accordingly
