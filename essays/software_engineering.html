<p>As we approach the end of my ICS 314 Software Engineering 1 class, I find myself reflecting on the copious amount of skills and techniques that I have acquired, realizing that I have barely touched the surface in terms of web application development. While the idea of creating web apps is essential to my work in the future, the foundation of this course is the teaching and growth of a deep understanding of software engineering concepts. In this essay, I will speak about the significance of open-source software development and configuration management, exploring their impacts beyond just web development.</p>

<h2 id="software-development-beyond-web-apps">Software Development: Beyond Web Apps</h2>

<p>A giant industry that stems from software engineering is that of software development, a skill set that extends far beyond just web applications. This class has provided an exploration into various programming interfaces and languages, teaching us to use Meteor and make full-stack applications. The focus on creating efficient, neat, maintainable code was also essential when it came to larger projects like our final group project. As I aspire to go into either IT or game development, I can recognize the role of software development in creating solutions fit for unique challenges that require unique solutions. Whether I am building algorithms for IT systems or coding the logic behind a video game, the core principles of software development will be the foundation for my work.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-management-maintaining-stability">Configuration Management: Maintaining Stability</h2>

<p>Configuration management is a concept that essentially encompasses the handling of a systemâ€™s configuration. This handling serves to ensure consistency and stability across diverse projects. In the realms of IT and game development, where there are intricate systems and dependencies, effective configuration management is essential to maintaining order amongst complex ideas. This is especially important when working in any group like a game development team. Managing deployment, software versions, and dependencies are critical in guaranteeing reliability across different projects.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this class has been a great help in furthering my love for computer science. The focus on the broader implications of software engineering really resonated with me and has helped me be more prepared for my future. Software development and configuration management are two very important parts of this software engineering discipline, helping to create a foundation for my knowledge for jobs that I may have later on.</p>
