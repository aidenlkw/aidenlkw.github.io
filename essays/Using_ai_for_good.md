# Using AI for, Good?
## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence has emerged somewhat suddenly to the public, being readily and easily available for use in many different fields. The use of AI has greatly impacted the learning landscape, particularly in Software Engineering. This essay reflects on my personal experiences with the use of AI in ICS 314, showing the impact of AI on my understanding of software engineering principles. Through mainly the use of ChatGPT, these tools have played a pivotal role in shaping my educational journey in all subjects.

## II. Personal Experience with AI:

As for in-class and homework exercises, these are my experiences with using AI.

### 1. Experience WODs
For these homework activities, I did not use AI for the most part. These assignments were pretty straightforward and easy to follow. If I ever had a problem with these assignments, I would just consult the video for help. Very rarely, the instructional video would be out of date or not have the same components as the current assignment, for example the first Test Cafe assignment, and I would have to get outside help. 
### 2. In-class Practice WODs
Usually for in-class practice WODs, I would use little AI or none at all. The practice WODs tended to be much easier and had more time, which meant more time to figure out the code yourself. Using little to no AI for these practice WODs helped me be faster during the actual WODs as well.
### 3. In-class WODs
I usually used a little AI during regular WODs if I couldn’t figure out the code immediately. For a few WODs, I spent a lot of time debugging a certain part of code with no luck, bringing me to use AI to find the bug. Usually it was just a typo or something but I would not have caught it without the use of AI. In my opinion, AI shouldn’t be used as a tool to do programming but rather supplement it by helping to debug, explain or give new solutions to problems. One example of a prompt I might give would be, “My picture doesn’t seem to be displaying correctly with this url, can you help?” In this case the image link was not a github raw url type which ChatGPT converted into such a link.
### 4. Essays
I rarely use AI for essays as they do not require it. The only use of AI in essays that I use sometimes is to give me a brief outline of a structure to my paper. Sometimes the hardest part of writing an essay is just starting it, which AI can be used to help.
### 5. Final Project
I am currently using AI to help with my group’s final project as there are many new ideas and components that haven’t been taught in class like searching for items for example. AI cannot just do my final project but it certainly helps with certain things like surrounding things in quotes, duplicating and changing key words in a file, amongst other things.
### 6. Learning a concept / tutorial
Most of the tutorials I have watched have taught me perfectly fine so I did not have a use for AI. I may use AI to help debug if I follow a tutorial and it does not work based on my system or file type but that would be all.
### 7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
I don’t really answer questions in class or Discord but if I do, then I would already know the answer from my brain - I would not ask AI for the answer to answer someone else. If someone asks a question, they likely already asked AI and/or google for the answer. 
### 8. Asking or answering a smart-question
As stated in number 7, I would not ask a question without consulting with the internet and/or AI first as those are more readily available than people. If I had the answer to someone’s smart question, I would answer just based on my personal experience.
### 9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
For prompts like this, I would just consult the documentation of Underscore or look online at stack overflow if I didn’t already know the answer. I wouldn’t necessarily use AI to answer this question as it would be easier to learn from reading elsewhere.
### 10. Explaining code
If the documentation or online could not explain the code, I would consult AI to explain the code. Throughout 314, I have just been able to figure out what the code does by either looking at past examples or looking it up on the internet. 
### 11. Writing code
I use AI a bit when writing code like when I have to make new pages for my project or help with homework. For example, I used ChatGPT to ask, “Can you make a basic page just displaying the navbar and footer.” And I would give it my navbar for reference for example. It would make a skeleton page just so I wouldn’t have to manually type out code for the basic parts of the page. I would then customize the page and add functionality. Another use I had was when I pasted data that had single quotes but needed double quotes. I could simply ask the AI to change the single quotes to double, which would work perfectly.
### 12. Documenting Code
Documenting goes hand in hand with understanding code. I know what my code is supposed to do and where it does it so I would be able to document what is going on myself. 
### 13. Quality assurance
This is my most used case for AI. Sometimes I spend so long trying to fix a bug where it could have easily been fixed had I seen it. I would just ask, “Something is preventing my code from doing ___” and then paste my code. This works most of the time and usually is just a typo. 
### 14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
I haven’t come across anything that hasn’t been mentioned already so far in my ICS 314 journey. 

## III. Impact of Learning and Understanding
The use of AI in education is definitely a double-edged sword in a sense. AI helps speed up production, giving users time to do other things like other classes and socialization, but impedes learning in most cases. For me, AI has been a positive tool for my learning. As I have ADHD, it is sometimes hard to start projects or find ways to split tasks into manageable parts. AI helps with this tremendously. For example, I have trouble starting essays and use AI to help me begin. I ask ChatGPT to make an outline for example to an essay, and I modify that outline for my own use. Many times just having something to look at helps me start writing which is all I really need. In other classes like chemistry, I use AI to help me make study guides. I ask it things like, “what are the main ideas of learning quantum numbers,” and I use those points as reference to what I should be paying attention to in the textbook, which I can then take notes on and study. However, AI also encourages my procrastination in some cases. If I forget to do a certain not as important assignment, I can ask AI to do most of it, modifying it to my liking as the assignment is due soon. I would then go back and learn the concepts myself after the due date. 

## IV. Practical Applications
AI is very useful in the real world outside of ICS 314. One of the main points of AI is that it can speed up production of certain things. Software engineers and game designers won’t need to spend as much time coding as they could be testing new, exciting things rather than fixing basic bugs. One major example in my life is one of my supervisors at my job in Desktop Network Services (DNS) in the library. My supervisor often talks about how people will not be hired in the future for software engineering jobs based on their coding but how well they can code with AI. As he mentions, he uses AI to help him code as well, using GPT 4 (the paid version of ChatGPT) and in his words, it has never failed him. If given good enough prompts, AI can do anything. We could see the rise of more consistent better-looking UIs as the backend of programming could be done with AI with more focus on the visuals by the humans. 

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
I have not had many challenges with AI as most of my use of it is minimal. I do think that embracing AI in education would benefit most people and get them ready for the future. In contrast to 314, my ICS 311 class highly scrutinizes the use of AI, possibly making it more used because of it. I believe that classes should embrace the use of AI as it will be unavoidable in the future. 

## VI. Comparative Analysis
No jobs in computer science will ask a worker to give them a history of Rome in essay form as you could just google it. Essential things like basics of coding languages and such should be learned traditionally but also can be expanded upon and enhanced through the use of AI and experimentation. For example, students should not have to ask AI how to print “hello world” in a programming language or how code should be formatted with indents and such. These particular parts and basics of coding should be learned from a teacher, traditionally, building this foundation for the student’s knowledge. As coding gets more and more complicated, it is difficult to memorize every little detail in a certain language. That is where AI comes in to help. If a student wants to know a new way to make a page using different lines of code, they could ask AI for different ways to tackle this problem. IN conclusion, I believe the basics of a subject should be taught traditionally, while AI is used to expand and enhance these basics. 

## VII. Future Considerations
I think AI will only become more advanced in the future. As I mentioned before, I think that people will be more likely to get hired in the future based on their affinity for the use of AI. People that can use AI to speed up their work would be invaluable to employers. AI is getting more and more advanced everyday, with no sign of stopping anytime soon. There was already a breakthrough this semester in the realm of ICS 314 as it is the first time AI is being encouraged. As for my experience, this is the first time AI is being embraced in any of my classes I have ever taken. All of my classes either don’t say anything about AI or condemn it. AI cannot be used for everything yet, as, for example, ChatGPT is always a year or so behind current events so other avenues must be used for research and information.

## VIII. Conclusion
All in all, I believe that AI can be used for good while it can also cause bad habits. AI can be used for debugging, explaining, expanding, and outlining tasks. In my case, I use AI to supplement my learning. I use it to start tasks, help me with problems I face, and help me open my mind to new possible solutions to problems. I really think that AI should be encouraged in education and teachers should educate students on how to use it effectively, without stunting their learning.
