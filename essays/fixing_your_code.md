While programming languages vary, one aspect remains constant and essential to them - coding standards. Coding standards in software development have a big role in learning a programming language as they standardize coding for all. While some standards may feel a bit nit-picky, they are all important.

## The Significance of Coding Standards

Coding standards are often mistaken for details that don't matter, like how many spaces to indent or newlines at the end of your code. However, they go beyond surface-level concerns and are essential in software development.

Coding standards provide a specific structure to codebases, making maintenance simpler, making it simpler to read which makes it easier to collaborate. When a team or class follows the same standards, it's easier to understand and work on/grade each other's code. Things like comments can help explain code as well without the author. Coding standards also address common programming errors and redundancies, helping developers avoid bugs and vulnerabilities. This leads to more robust and secure software.

## Coding Standards as a Learning Tool

Beyond just maintaining code quality, coding standards help aid in learning a new programming language. Coding standards offer a structured approach to programming.The standards guide learners through a language's syntax and usage, making it easier for learners to navigate. Learners can instead focus on grasping the language's concepts rather than struggling with messy code. Adhering to coding standards helps learners get help using the correct syntax from outside sources as well.

## My Preference for Eclipse with Checkstyle

While both ESLint with IntelliJ and Eclipse with Checkstyle are valuable tools for enforcing coding standards, I prefer the latter due to its intuitive nature. Setup is more straightforward and requires minimal effort compared to IntelliJ. ESLint and Checkstyle both provide instant feedback as you write code, helping you identify and fix issues while coding. Getting the green checkmark in any IDE is always a fun and rewarding goal to achieve.
