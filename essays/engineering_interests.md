## Getting a Head Start in the Real World

Software engineering is a field that I have always been interested in.There are so many professions which involve software engineering, all in their own, unique ways. One of my primary interests in this software engineering course is the development of a professional portfolio. Having a portfolio readily available will certainly help with job searches in the future as it displays all of my accomplishments in one neat place. 

## The Industry Must-Know

In addition, I am particularly motivated on mastering JavaScript, given its importance in the software development world. JavaScript is the backbone of web development and is widely used in the tech industry. Its versatility and applicability is why it is so important to learn. Being as popular as it is, there is much documentation on the language online to help with my learning.

## You Got to be Quicker Than That!

Adding to these interests, I look to enhance my coding speed and efficiency through the Workouts of the Day (WODs). Quick problem-solving and efficient coding are essential skills in software engineering and the coding industry as a whole, where speed can land you a job or not. Regularly completing the WODs will not only boost my problem-solving abilities but also help me become more resourceful with researching to solve problems as the WODs are open internet. This skill will be invaluable as I go through my life as a computer science major.
