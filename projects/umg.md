Untitled Mech Game was an entry for the 2022 Mechjam III competition hosted on itch.io. I joined the University of Hawaii Game Dev Club a little after this competitoion started and was new to game design. The team consisted of a team of 11 with 4 main coders, 6 artists, and 1 sound designer (me). The Mechjam is a form of "gamejam" where teams make games pertaining to a certain theme in a relatively short amount of time. This jam's theme was robot mechs. 

Our submission to the Mechjam was a simple, 2d puzzle-platformer wher the player switches between 3 different mechs. One mech can plant seeds which can be watered to form a platform, another mech can use fire to burn vines or plants, and the third can spray water to put out fire or to grow the plant mech's seeds. Players use these three mechs as tools to get to the exit of each level.
