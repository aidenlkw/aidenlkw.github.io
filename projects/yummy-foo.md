## The Overview

For my final project in my software engineering class, my group was assigned the task of creating a website that hosts recipies for college students. These recipes were designed to be affordable and easy to make for a college student. The main point of this project was to help these college students as they might not have a lot of equipment to create many dishes and recipes they find online. On our website, students can add their own recipes, inputting ingredients, appliance, cost and other criteria. Users can also add recipes to their favorites to use time and time again. We decided to name this project Yummy Foo as a play on words in both food and the use of foo as a variable in coding. 

## Major Contributions

My contributions to this project was creating the user guidde and the admin page's functionality. I worked on testing for a few of the pages as well. 

For the admin page, admins needed to be able to remove and edit recipes that users create. As this site is made for college students, there are bound to be some troublemakers amongst the lot. For this very reason, vertain students would have admin acces to facilitate what recipes are allowed to stay, and which need editing or removal. 

To tackle this problem, I first focused on the easy part which was the removal of the recipes. For the admin page, it carried over details from our search page for recipes so that the admin could search up troubled recipes. On each recipe card, I added a button which only appears to admins that would remove the selected recipe from the database. 

Editing a recipe was much different in comparison. To edit a recipe, I added a button that opens a modal to edit the recipe. Admins can edit the name, ingredients, picture, instructions, appliances, allergens, and the cost and can then press submit. This then updates the database to have the edited data. 

My biggest contributions to this project include implementing search functionality, adding translation capabilities, building the back-end, and deploying the application. Although, I would typically be debugging or assisting teammates in addition to my primary tasks.

As for the user guide, I just created a walk through on our group project's homepage helping users navigate step-by-step. I included screenshots of each page and how they function, telling the user how to complete basic tasks on the site like adding or favoriting recipes. 

## Takeaways

This ICS course taught me a lot about web development and it was rewarding to apply it to a project of my own. My group thought thtat this project would be too diffuclt a task for our given timeframe, but were pleasantly suprised when we finished it on time. We got to implement everything we wanted and were happy with the resulting website. I feel that I could not have done this project by myself. Just talking to even one group mate to help with problems significantly sped up my thinking and coding process. I also ran into a few problems that could have been solved by thinking of a simpler approach. One instance of this was when I was trying to figure out the edit function. I was going down this rabbit hole of complicated solution when one of my groupmates mentioned an example from earlier in the semeser. After that moment, i realised I was thinking too hard and quickly solved my problem. In conclusion, I learned a lot about web development and strengthened my love for group work and learning with others. We were proud of what we accomplished in the short time frame for our project.
